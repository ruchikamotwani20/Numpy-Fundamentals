# NumPy Basics

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook covering the fundamentals of NumPy, including its advantages, applications, and usage in Python and Data Science.

## About NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides high-performance multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions for efficient data processing.

## Why Use NumPy?
- High-performance array computations optimized for speed  
- Memory-efficient compared to Python lists  
- Vectorized operations eliminate the need for explicit loops  
- Comprehensive mathematical functions, including linear algebra and statistics  
- Seamless integration with Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Machine Learning libraries  

## Applications in Data Science
NumPy is widely used in Data Science and Machine Learning for:  
- Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Linear algebra and matrix operations  
- Scientific computing and simulations
